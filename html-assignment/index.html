    <h2>about me</h2>
    <p>My name is <strong>Kenza</strong>. i'm from <strong>Algeria</strong> and I currently livein <strong>Canada</strong>, specifically in Montreal.
    I'm a student at <emphassis>algonquin college</emphassis>, my program called <mark><abbr title="Intractive Media Design"> IMD</abbr></mark>, and im learning web development. I like technology, creativity, and visual design.</p>
<p> I have been living in canada for almost three years. Even though it has been difficult to adapt to a new country and to be far from <strong> my family</strong>, I decided to stay strong and continue my journey. I am here to achieve my dream of becoming a designer and a photographer. Ib believe that hard work and patience will help me reach my goals.</p>
